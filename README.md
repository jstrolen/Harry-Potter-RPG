# Harry Potter RPG


Most of the code has been rewritten.

Usage: compile (working on runnable jar and exe), move: WASD, left click: cast, right click: self-cast, scrolling: spell change (working on middle mouse button)

Older project, 2D Harry Potter game (magic, destroyable environment, ...).

Testing level available, refactoring necessary.
